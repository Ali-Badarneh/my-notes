## _`Summray`_
1- _One of the fact that every devoloper must have in mind is the idea of the purpose of the software is not to show off how intelligent you are , but to help people_.
2- _The most important goal of the software design is to design systems that can be created and maintained as easily as possible by their developers, so that they can be and continue to be as helpful as possible. **Max Kanat-Alexander**, Code Simplicity_
3- _A good developer creates things that are easy to understand so that it’s really easy to shake out all the bugs_ , `simplicity is the ultimate sophistication`. **Leonardo da Vinci**
4- _Simplicity and complexity are the two main factors that affect code maintenance ,t he ease of maintenance of any piece of software is proportional to the simplicity of its individual pieces , the effort of maintenance is proportional to the complexity of the software,
**The one rule that you should follow about maintenance is:**
It is more important to reduce the effort of maintenance than it is to reduce the effort of implementation,
